Connection: Force binding to be done through the bind method. Do not allow
sendRequest to be used for binding. Simplifies the "special case" handling...do
the same thing for unbind.

Tests on optional parameters: are they encoding to output stream properly. Any
exceptions in 'em. Basically: test them!

examples / tests cleanup. Args.java...where does it go?

Code up Outbind and a simple outbind listener class!

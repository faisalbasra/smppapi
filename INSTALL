How to build
------------

To build you'll need a version of Jakarta Ant installed. I currently use
Ant 1.5.1. You can get Ant from http://ant.apache.org/

Build the API by issuing the command
ant all

This will build the Jar files, javadoc documentation and build and run the JUnit
test suite. The jar files will be placed in the lib sub-directory.


Notes on building the API
-------------------------

If you're building the API from scratch, be wary of the locale you're building
in. A number of the alphabet encoding classes contain characters in them that
may cause problems depending on your locale. The source files are in the
ISO-8859-1 character encoding format.

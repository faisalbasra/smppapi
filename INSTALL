How to build
------------

To build you'll need a version of Apache Ant 1.6 or better installed,
or use Eclipse. J2SE 1.4 or better is required.

You can get Ant from http://ant.apache.org/
Eclipse can be obtained from http://www.eclipse.org/

Build the API by issuing the command
ant all

This will build the Jar files, javadoc documentation and build and run the JUnit
test suite. The jar files will be placed in the lib sub-directory.

The smppapi is developed using the Eclipse IDE and the source tree contains
all of the relevant project control files.

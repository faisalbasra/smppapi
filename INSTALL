How to build
------------

To build you'll need a version of Jakarta Ant installed, version 1.3 or
better. You can get Ant from http://jakarta.apache.org/

Build the API by issuing the command
ant dist

This should create a subdirectory called 'dist' which contains the smppapi.jar
file. That's all there is to it.

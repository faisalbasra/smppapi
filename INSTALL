How to build
------------

To build you'll need a version of Apache Maven 2.0.9 or better installed,
or use Eclipse. J2SE 1.5 or better is required.

You can get Maven from http://maven.apache.org/
Eclipse can be obtained from http://www.eclipse.org/

Build the API by issuing the command
mvn install

This will build the Jar files, javadoc documentation and build and run the
test suite. All files will be built to the "target" sub-directory.

The smppapi is developed using the Eclipse IDE and the source tree contains
all of the relevant project control files.
